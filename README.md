Here’s a basic `README.md` file for a Crop Yield Prediction app built using Streamlit in Python:

# Crop Yield Prediction App

This is a **Crop Yield Prediction** application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) in Python. The app predicts crop yield based on several factors such as climate, soil, and farming practices. The prediction is powered by a machine learning model, and the goal is to help farmers and agricultural experts estimate yield for better decision-making.

## Features

- **User-friendly interface**: Easy-to-use interface for entering data such as rainfall, temperature, soil type, and crop type.
- **Machine Learning model**: Uses a trained model to predict the crop yield based on input data.
- **Real-time prediction**: Get instant predictions as you adjust the input values.
- **Interactive visualization**: Visualize the predicted yield and explore how different factors affect the results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-yield-prediction-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd crop-yield-prediction-app
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Input Features

- **Rainfall**: Average rainfall during the growing season (in mm).
- **Temperature**: Average temperature (in °C).
- **Soil Type**: Choose from different soil types such as sandy, loamy, or clay.
- **Crop Type**: Select from a variety of crops such as rice, wheat, maize, etc.

## Output

The app predicts the estimated crop yield in tons per hectare based on the input features. It also provides interactive graphs for better insights into how various factors impact the yield.

## Files in the Repository

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `model.pkl`: Pre-trained machine learning model used for prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the app.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample data files for training or testing the model.
- `README.md`: Documentation file for the project.

## How to Use

1. Enter the required input values such as rainfall, temperature, soil type, and crop type in the provided fields.
2. The app will predict the crop yield instantly based on the input data.
3. Explore the impact of different inputs on the predicted yield through interactive visualizations.

## Model Training (Optional)

If you want to train the model with your own data, follow these steps:

1. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Update the training script (`train_model.py`) with the path to your dataset.
3. Run the training script to generate a new model:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Replace the `model.pkl` file with the newly trained model.
